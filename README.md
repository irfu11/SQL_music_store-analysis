 **SQL_music_store-analysis**

A complete SQL project where I analyze sales, customers, tracks, genres, artists, and employee performance of a Music Store using PostgreSQL.

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing end-to-end data analysis of a digital Music Store database.
The goal is to explore customer behavior, track performance, sales trends, and music preferences using advanced SQL queries.

I have analyzed multiple key areas such as:

Sales performance

Popular genres and artists

Customer demographic insights

Employee (sales support) performance

Track duration, pricing, and revenue

Country-wise and city-wise purchasing patterns

This project demonstrates my ability to work with joins, subqueries, CTEs, window functions, aggregate functions, and complex SQL logic.
